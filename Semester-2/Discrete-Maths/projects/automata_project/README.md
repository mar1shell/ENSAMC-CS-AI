## âœ¨ Key Features & Algorithms

- **Technology Stack:** Built entirely in **Python** utilizing `matplotlib` for graph visualization and `tkinter` for the GUI.
- **Core Functionality:** Create, edit, save, and visualize both **Deterministic (DFA)** and **Non-deterministic (NFA)** Finite Automata.
- **Conversion:** Implements the **Subset Construction Algorithm** to convert NFAs to equivalent DFAs.
- **Minimization:** Implements **Hopcroft's Algorithm** for efficient DFA minimization.
- **Simulation:** Features animated step-by-step visualization of word processing on the automaton.
- **Advanced Operations:** Includes set operations (Union, Intersection, Complement) and equivalence testing between automata.
