# Workshop 2: Advanced Algorithms

This repository contains the exercises for Workshop 2 on Advanced Algorithms. The workshop focuses on Heaps, Heap Sort, and Merge Sort. It includes both manual solutions and Python implementations.

## Structure
- **Part 1:** Exercises 0, 1, and 2 focusing on tree traversal, Max-Heap construction, and manual Heap Sort.
- **Part 2:** Exercises 1 and 2 focusing on Merge Sort and Heap Sort in Python.

## Files
- `algo TP2.pdf`: The workshop document in French.
- `Part1/`: Contains exercises related to tree traversal and heap-related concepts.
- `Part2/`: Contains Python implementations of Merge Sort and Heap Sort.

## Topics Covered
1. Tree traversal (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level-order)
2. Max-Heap construction
3. Heap Sort (manual and programmatic)
4. Merge Sort
