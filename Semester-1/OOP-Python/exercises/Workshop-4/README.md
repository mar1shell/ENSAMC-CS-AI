# Workshop 4 - Solution: GUI with Tkinter

This repository contains solutions for **Workshop 4** of the OOP with Python course. The focus of this workshop was to create interactive **Tkinter** applications. The solution is split into **Activity 2** and **Activity 3**, which cover adding interactivity to a GUI and creating a window for text insertion and character counting.

## Activities Overview

### Activity 2 - Addition of Numbers and Tkinter Interactivity
- **Objective**: Enhance an existing Tkinter code by adding interactivity to allow users to input two numbers, click a button to add them together, and display the result in the GUI.
- The user can enter two numbers, press a button, and see the sum displayed on the same window.

### Activity 3 - Text Insertion and Character Counting
- **Objective**: Create a window where users can input text, and upon pressing a button, the program will display the number of characters in the inserted text.
- The user enters text into a text field, clicks a button to count characters, and the result is shown in a label.

## Project Structure

- `activity-2.py`: Solution for **Activity 2**. This script allows the user to add two numbers and displays the result using Tkinter.
- `activity-3.py`: Solution for **Activity 3**. This script creates a text input field and counts the characters when a button is pressed.
- `activity-2.pdf`: Exercise document in french for **Activity 2**
- `activity-3.pdf`: Exercise document in french for **Activity 3**

## Prerequisites

Before running the solution, make sure you have the following:
- Python 3.x installed.
- Tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python).
