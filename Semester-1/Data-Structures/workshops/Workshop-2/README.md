## üìù Exercise Descriptions

### Exercise 1: Valid Parentheses Handling  
This exercise implements a stack-based solution to check whether a string containing parentheses (e.g., `()`, `{}`, `[]`) is valid. A string is valid if:  
1. Every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.  
2. Brackets are closed in the correct order.

### Exercise 2: Back and Forward Buttons for Web Pages  
This exercise simulates a browser's back and forward functionality using two stacks. The solution allows:  
- Navigating to a new page.  
- Moving back to the previous page.  
- Moving forward to a page after going back.
