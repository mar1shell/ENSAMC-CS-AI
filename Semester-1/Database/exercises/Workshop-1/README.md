# Project Overview

This repository contains solutions to a series of SQL exercises organized across multiple `.sql` files. Each file is structured to tackle different aspects of SQL and database management, covering foundational to more advanced topics. *Note: All questions are provided in French.*

## f1.sql
The `f1.sql` file contains the script to create the database if `SYSDATE` is in the format `01-JAN-2024`. This script sets up the database environment based on the specified date format.

## tp1.sql
The `tp1.sql` file contains the solutions to the following activities:

1. **Activity 1: Simple SELECT Queries**
    - Writing basic `SELECT` statements to retrieve data from a single table, focusing on understanding SQL syntax.

2. **Activity 2: Using WHERE Conditions**
    - Using the `WHERE` clause to filter data based on various criteria.

3. **Activity 3: Using Monoline Functions**
    - Implementing functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, and string manipulation within `SELECT` statements.

4. **Activity 4: Using Joins**
    - Writing `SELECT` queries to join multiple tables using different join types.

## tp2.sql
The `tp2.sql` file continues with more advanced activities:

5. **Activity 5: Group By Function**
    - Using `GROUP BY` to aggregate data and apply functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `AVG` on grouped results.

6. **Activity 6: Subqueries**
    - Practicing nested queries to retrieve specific data from related tables, understanding subquery placement and execution.

7. **Activity 7: Data Manipulation**
    - Performing `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations to modify existing data within tables.

8. **Activity 8: Creating Tables and Structures**
    - Writing `CREATE TABLE` statements to define new database structures, including setting up primary keys, data types, and other constraints.

Each section is designed to build up your SQL knowledge through hands-on practice. Happy coding!
