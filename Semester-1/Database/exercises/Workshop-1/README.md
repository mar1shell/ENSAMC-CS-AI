# Project Overview

## f1.sql
The `f1.sql` file contains the script to create the database if `SYSDATE` is in the format `01-JAN-2024`. This script ensures that the database is set up correctly based on the specified date format.

## tp1.sql
The `tp1.sql` file contains the solutions to the following activities:

1. **Activity 1: Simple SELECT Queries**
    - This activity involves writing basic `SELECT` statements to retrieve data from a single table. It focuses on understanding the fundamental syntax of SQL queries.

2. **Activity 2: Using WHERE Conditions**
    - This activity focuses on using the `WHERE` clause to filter data in `SELECT` queries. It includes writing conditions to retrieve specific subsets of data based on various criteria.

3. **Activity 3: Using Monoline Functions**
    - This activity involves using SQL functions within `SELECT` statements to perform operations on data. It includes functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, and string manipulation functions.

4. **Activity 4: Using Joins**
    - This activity covers writing `SELECT` queries that involve joining multiple tables. It includes using different types of joins to combine data from related tables.

Each activity is designed to help you understand and practice different aspects of SQL and database management.
